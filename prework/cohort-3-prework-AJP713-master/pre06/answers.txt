3) This loop would terminate for any positive integer input of n.  Even numbers are divided in half while odd numbers only increase by one.  For all numbers greater than 2 dividing by two makes the number smaller than the addding one makes it larger.  There could be several divide by two in a row but there can only ever be one add one in a row because then it would switch to an even number and be divided.  The number will become smaller relatively fast and eventually reach one.
