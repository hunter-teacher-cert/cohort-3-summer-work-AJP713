Adam = skeleton with built-in tests and what the answers should be
Sam = comments with pre and post conditions
Seth = random grouping 
Patti = Heterogeneous Grouping
Yeidy = presenting work after and explaing steps, and challnege them to explain in a clearer way

What is Computer Science?
- 
from
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science :
"Computer science is the study of computation, automation, and information. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, information theory and automation) to practical disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software). Computer science is generally considered an area of academic research and distinct from computer programming."
from
https://www.britannica.com/science/computer-science :
"Computer science is the study of computers and computing as well as their theoretical and practical applications."
